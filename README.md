# Archipelago Manual for Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017)
This is an Archipelago implementation of the game Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017) using Manual. This manual is intended to be played using the pc version of the game, but theoretically should be playable on consoles as well.

# Setup
Grab the apworld and yaml from [releases](https://github.com/Chalk33/Archipelago-Manual-Star-Wars-Battlefront-2-2017/releases/latest). Place the apworld in lib/worlds. Place the yaml in the Players folder, and edit it accordingly.

If playing on pc, it is highly recommended to use the [Frosty Mod Manager](https://github.com/CadeEvs/FrostyToolsuite/releases) and the [Instant Action Overhaul XL mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/starwarsbattlefront22017/mods/9310). The manual is designed with these in mind.

# How it Works
## Locations
- Campaign Levels
- Completing matches on planets
- Completing matches on maps
- Winning matches as each faction
- Defeating faction enemies
- Defeating heroes and villains
- Capturing Command Posts in Missions or Supremacy
- Completing Blast matches (optional)

## Items
- Campaign Levels (in batches)
- Trooper classes
- Reinforcements
- Vehicles
- Heroes and Villains
- Factions
- Planets
- Kyber Crystals (victory items)

## Game Flow
When starting the manual you will receive one faction, one trooper class, and one map. In addition, the campaign prologue mission (The Cleaner) is freely unlocked. Further campaign missions will unlock in batches. The bulk of the manual is completed in Instant Action by, in most cases, simply playing the game.

Victory is currently achieved by acquiring all 10 Kyber Crystal items. For shorter multiworlds feel free to claim victory with a lower amount.
